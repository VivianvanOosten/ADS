This repository will detail my progress during the course Applied Data Science, which I am taking parallel to an internship working in the DataLab of a mortgage services firm (Stater) and to a student assistantship for the course Machine Learning. I have a more theoretical background in machine learning, which is why I am a student assistant there. The goal for this course however, is to provide me with some relevant practical experience and practical tips to apply my theoretical knowledge. 

Here, I will give a brief overview of what the course taught me. If you want to see work I have done within the course, feel free to click along to the relevant folders. At the end of the course, my goal is to have one Shiny dashboard showing all of my progress. That is still a work in progress ;)

Week 1: Introduction. 
During this week, Kings day prevented the lecture from happening so we only installed RStudio (which I already had) and took a look at the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning.
